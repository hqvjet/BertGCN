@celtjules66 i think johnson likes this extreme form of social control. it is surely time to revolt against this madness. the vulnerable and over 60s have mostly all been double vaccinated &amp; for the over 50s it is imminent. depression kills as well, further restrictions make it more likely.
is this first cybex isokinetic dynamometer? @drandrewbateman #prs2021
all these antivax and antimask people dying of covid, i think is less about them staying true to their beliefs and more that they literally can’t imagine it happening to them, no matter how much it happens to others. “rip to you but i’m different” playing out on a mass scale
tried the first hour or so of tales of arise and it's already showing good signs. only major issue i have is the lack of the local co-op i've come to expect from tales.

hindsight is a wonderful thing, but surely the head hochos at efl, fa, uefa, fifa should've cut some matches when starting the season a month late- no need for so many european ties with 2 legs, international friendlies nor league cup. so many injuries already- many more to come.

i don't follow the women's super league because my team aren't in. southampton have built their women's team from grassroots and youth up, rather than just buying their way into the elite. i am proud of them for that.

damn, imagine being vaxxed and then getting a cold and then losing your taste and smell. oh wait.
i can't tell if my professors keep skipping/delaying introductions because grad school is so serious and important that you have to immediately dive into material, or if because classes at au haven't been in-person in two years all the profs are majorly disoriented

woah. this anime recommendation i am identifying with way too hard tbh. because it is pretty spot on. it is also so dark i should probably not even mention the name. owo
watching the sopranos is neat. the overarching theme of characters dealing with the dissonance of real life vs nostalgia/popular entertainment portrayals of the mob is engaging. also fun watching said badass mobsters dealing with the monotony of suburbia.
@johnjbrea @lad_lew @ladyblueclr @realdonaldtrump it's probably something closer to xenophobia. which is someone hating someone else just because they're foreign. i mean, you are an english teacher, aren't you? figured you might know that.
idk how to explain it but watching snap videos takes energy

@whoislici i think you're so cool! :)
like all humans, i make some decisions that go against the best interests of myself or others. one such decision is sometimes eating too much sugar, another was consuming animal products. i would love the government to nudge me towards better decisions. #nationalfoodstrategy

@davret1 @repcori @sam_a_bell that’s how things like this get so bad. if everyone says it’s not their problem and nobody actually does anything about it, nothing does happen. the us government can use the fed to take action, and it should— even if it’s not their “job” officially

absolutely disgusting. tr*mp says he “loves” domestic terrorists and spends most of the minute long video complaining about election and not condemning their actions today? rot in fucking hell.

@kirstiealley you're swallowing trump's rhetoric without proof. there is zero evidence of anything illegal happening. you're blindly following and gullible for believing. proof is always needed. and the burden of proof is on the accuser. disappointed to see what you really are.

reporting on this ceasefire makes it sound like both sides agreed to stop the violence. but you don't get to call a t.o. when you're getting chased down by a leopard. this "ceasefire" is just israel saying it'll pause its ethnic cleansing for a little while.

@professorshine @cmclymer not really. if she had competed while knowing she wasn't performing at her best, she could have dragged down the whole team. by stepping down, she did what was best for the team and allowed another to step up. they won a silver olympic medal, that's pretty damn impressive.

weekend trip to chester 🚂recommendations and top tips welcome please… 🙂🙂
what i love about this iconic scene is that geri proved that’s it’s possible to overact, whilst being unable to actually act. that’s pretty fascinating.
if only being clever, meant people had the ability to challenge and discuss the things they think they know, rather than repeating what they've been taught
politics is like waves, they depend on the wind where it blows
respectable draw &amp; good performance in france, resting some key players &amp; extra minutes in tank for some , looking forward to the draw on monday 😉🔴⚪️🔵
there are a bazillion things to do in my small town of wadsworth. one thing you can do is ride horses on the moon and sing songs with abe lincoln in the bar. on top of that, i recommend eating a hundred gallons of ice cream at any local ice cream shop downtown. some of the flavors that they have are out of this world! additionally in the winter, i like to go over to a place called kill hill next to the main highway. the hill is up extremely high, you can see the whole world from there! it has to be at least a million feet tall!
government- “all over 40’s must have booster jab by end of january!” nhs website *rubs hands together in glee* “oh yes? i think not…!” 🙄

if they oust johnson as pm, won’t his replacement just say all of the tories’ corruption was a symptom of his premiership and not endemic? will faith in the conservatives be restored &amp; get them re-elected?

grant mccann on a nice run of results with hull👍
so many error codes in r today!
it makes perfect sense that the government is forcing face masks in shops, but all drunk people in bars are immune from covid apparently. moral of story, alcohol cures everything.

how has salah missed that goal? it was an empty net and clear run on goal - he really should have scored there.
after 20 years in germany, i had forgotten how downright civil standard interactions in london can be. politics, of course, aside.

mercedes’ either lost a lot of pace or red bull found a lot, interesting tomorrow with red bull starting on the softs.
i'm a bit biased but i have to say this was fantastic. the talent in the young people on our island is amazing. well done everyone. please retweet if you saw the production and agree with me.
no of course not because there are no decent people involved in these attacks on him
"does salah want to score today, even my grand mother could have scored that open goal!"
boris johnson is consistently a lying, cheating, deceitful bastard and the fact that his team held a christmas party in 10 downing street when he was telling the rest of the country to cancel christmas celebrations sums up his hypocricy and then lies after the fact
smashing records and recently won a race by 38 seconds. does anyone genuinely think this is fair?
this makes me feel uneasy ngl
leaving so much behind in 2021 with lessons learned. come on 2022 be big and be beautiful 🤞🏻
i fed my children some sweets before bedtime and now regret it.
michael carricks interview after the chelsea game, "i thought we were unlucky not to get the 3 points today" 3 points, i am sure you have to start shooting to score goals to win games !!!

how kind of the conservative party to cancel their christmas get together this year, i mean they didn't have enough parties last year, did they?
and now doubled with further rises in the pipeline.
it's so weird how i look ugly in photos but i also look ugly in the mirror
i think we also need a conversation about truthfulness and impartiality in the media?
i’m sorry but both of those chelsea penalties are terrible decisions
what a day that was 👌
this is just unbelievable. you hear 70 people died in a tornado in the usa in 2021 and wonder how and then you see this…
good news good luck my mate 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

why does every single company need a christmas advert? like whats the point they're all pointless after a certain point.

i went to the best restaurant today for dinner. it was absolutely amazing. my steak was cold and the fries were rock solid. i expected my food to be mouth watering and it sure was when i had to wash each bite down with my drink.
so, this renders testing, and even getting vaccinated absolutely pointless. i wish i hadn't bothered 😕
rubbish
my gut feeling is always right.
i would say, i wish there was a parenting manual that could help parents out for basic needs like social emotional help, how to make sure your child feels understood, and what things cause trauma in children.

their reason for grabbing and holding on to power is to scam as much money from us ordinary citizens (proles) as they can. they see this as enterprising and virtuous. i see it as corruption and theft.

omicron seems to be a big threat, i think we should drop inquiries into last years parties and focus on this instead.
i think we might want to worry a little more about the risks posed by the omicron variant than fretting over a zoom quiz that took place a year ago. just a thought.
sure, vaccines make no difference to covid spread; that's why the hospitals are full of unvaccinated people. are you able to do the maths?

"do a phd, it'll be fun and rewarding," said no clinically sane person. ever. i repeat. ever.
i'm sure i'm getting more laid back about the whole virus thing. there is speculation about a possible lockdown after christmas, and i've got to the stage of "never mind, we've had 3 already..."
it's beggars belief that the met police suggest they can't, or won't, investigate crimes that have already been committed.

politicians are nothing more than a corrupt, vile, self-serving wastes of thieves with a contempt for the electorate they purport to serve.

so boris has made a hash of brexit, let 150,000 people die and lied through his teeth but still thinks he deserves a boozy bash! nothing surprises me about him any more sadly.
this is fantastic! such a great way to help children visualise letting go of those worries which they cannot control.

john major followed by… anna soubry……followed by…phillip hammond…..topped off with ed davey, jo swinson ( “next candidate for prime minister) and pièce de résistance ian blackford (+ obligatory mince pie 🥧)
got back from the shop only to realise the milk i just bought is already out of date :(
gonna hit the sack after a long day. catch you 2moz. night night 💤💜

diversidy communidy. securidy. stadus. all pinned onto an otherwise rp accent. eesh, some audiobooks are just so … huffffff.
bo jo clearly knew about the wine and cheese party happening in his own house.
feel bad that i’m not chatting to everyone but i’ve not got the energy to be social 😅
slightly annoyed watching graham norton and how condescending he was towards henry cavill.
at my favourite cafe: barista: it's your birthday today? you must be like, 30, right? i'm 23 but no hard feelings...
yes you look fantastic for your age, thank the lord for filters hey!
reminds me of the time i told the lads i’m getting a round in then asked them to pay them self
pov it’s your first season watching f1
i had a dream i had hair 😭
well. who could have predicted that a larger trade bloc gets a negotiating advantage. extraordinary. i wonder if david davis knew that.
it was a great day! bit tired now 😴
yeah those day 2 tests cost a f*cking fortune fair dooz
never will be repeated, as you say you had to have lived through those times, as much as are fans are 100% , we were a different breed 😉.
how convenient, just when bobby’s back
i just love the weather in edinburgh have to dress for every season peeing with rain this morning now beautiful blue skys!! just love getting soaked 😤
this behemoth gets to dictate the health policies to the people of belgium..... now you see the hypocrisy and corruption in politics.
i just love the smell of one million 😍
wow i love it when rich people get stuff for free.
nice horse, but i just can’t get excited for such a nice horse in such rancid hands. ( not the jockey i must say )
16:00 gmt: temp: 13.2°c, wind: w, 2 mph (ave), 6 mph (gust), humidity: 90%, rain (hourly) 0.0 mm, pressure: 1015 hpa, rising slowly
i really hope we don’t go into another lockdown, i’d hate to do it all again.
78: 1-1. kearney with the equaliser.
we need better control of the ball, get it changed ralf mason for marcus, donny for bruno
so stoked to see them tonight
jamie rednapp is so bad 🤣
going to manchester the cheap and pretty way. avanti too expensive so on a split ticket with lm/wm via crewe/stafford.
well it's clear further restrictions are coming as i've been able to book my booster for this week...🤒🤕🥴
i’ll wait to start christmas shopping then. just in case, you know.
so you had to cancel your christmas party? worry not, this is how you do it, in a true christmas spirit 👇🏻
“you’re english right?” “yeah, big time”
absolutely shocking from grealish. take him off
great welsh karaoke rewrites (pt 94): 'cyfarthfa park is melting in the dark ...' 🎶🎙
mendy dives after the ball hits the net!!!! why didn’t he play like that against us 😡
several..love how you've omitted the number you oddball. 13 and counting to your...5?
why stop there? let’s hear from a night club specialist as well…
sad to see the number of cars engines idling all over town really disgusting it's not that cold.🤬
truss: as a cooper wrote “a remained lobotomised by ideology”
what if my work friends are also just….my friends? can we party together as long as we don’t talk about work? very confused.
the joys of academia; spending 2 whole weeks to be working on an application to be told in feedback that it scored strongly (but didn't get it)
another jab to protect myself? more pokes i get i’ll pop
i'm so glad that smart people are still refusing to wear masks in shops. thanks to their selflessness it highlights that if we just ignore something it'll go away – don't know why we haven't all tried it.
i really hate being stuck at home thanks to the governments lack of controls on covid in school.
meant to be having a relaxing bath after a hard week - instead get asked three times where other people's stuff is around the house. grrr...
i absolutely loveee not getting a graduation ceremony after i spent 3 years on my degree and ended up over £50,000 in debt
we are going to have a tough time in the semis but itll be litty and practice 🔥🔥🔥
one of my favorite stops in london!
when was the last time we named the same starting 11 for 3 games in a row
mannnnnnn , ain’t nothing like it
it’s my last day of being 50…feeling melancholy 😢
wow, glad i spent my entire christmas away from family last year.
hoping one will be johnson doing the locomotion.
you people just casually share wisdom on here and i’m really grateful for it ❤️❤️
i love working in the office instead of home. i wish they did a wax melt of bob's bo so that i could smell it at home too.
i don't like that barbers don't accept card payments, it should be normalised.
it was a great fun and all for a couple of very worthy causes - we raised £150! thank you for everyone’s support 👍
can’t believe i’m going to miss the swansea pumps
it appears that while the u.k. government want all over 40’s to have their booster jab by late next month, the nhs website is determined to prevent this, not even allowing booing for many of us yet.
the chillies are wayyyyy too prominent and raw
leak the xmas banger from sark
it's like the whole world is becoming woke to the rise of right wing nationalism and its horrific consequences.
here mate, take a pic of me cus ronaldo scored and make sure i have my pint of coors in my hand. nonce
man u are bang average so far tonight
actually enjoyed matt's commentary today, great result for the hawks too. which is most important.
i love it when my neighbours children block the drive because they can’t cook their own meals every single day!!!
i love how instagram can motivate people. i saw a post by kim kardashian and i was motivated to delete my account.
very angry that the government went ahead with their christmas parties while the rest of us were locked down
not what you meed 10 men against city
you're telling me somebody pegged my clothes?
such a tease. what do we think? labour +8 or con +6?
new video up tonight! hint: 🍮🍽🎨🖼😍
another example of anime not translating into live action very well. just leave it alone x
one of my favorite stops in london!
big drank by meg hard idc son🔥😭
today is not a good day when truth is betrayed by lies, deceit and bigotry. i feel broken.
that's all that needs to be said....
best thing about being just under 5’ is the fact i’m so easy to throw around 😅
i would say: i think it's funny that somebody decides to resign because they went to a party that they made out never happened, when it actually did! resigning does not make the situation acceptable!
well rags one but not much of a team still way of where got to be to compete with city liverpool brighton
"the win is meaningless."
ahshehdgs on my way to yhe arena i’m literally gonna throw up my stomach feels so weird
this gets me buzzing for next thursday, aw i can’t wait 🤩🤩
wheyy confirmation for sunday, no idea what team i'm in but ay will be good fun
when you hear mike dean is on var you know what happens next. he tried desperately to cancel our shout for a penalty.
i wish kelly were my friend. 🥰
someone teach me
woke up from a weird stress dream about our office in poland which strangely had a korean bbq in the canteen and one of the broth options was oat milk 🤢
really looking forward to going christmas shopping with my anti-vax, anti-mask, global conspiracy believing sister this weekend.
give phil a rest tomorrow: ederson walker dias laporte cancelo kdb rodri 🔫🐶 sterling jesus grealish
only one queen for me, the one who livesiverpool way 🤣🤗
i really loved the drive into work today in the dark, wet, heavy rain
can’t believe people think the covid vaccine will plant a tracker inside you. it’s for the benefit of your health and nothing else.
merry christmas to you all best wishes ♥️
my employers take many opportunities to make me unhappy.
this is what i’ve predicted 👀
johnson’s levelling up will do as much for the north as cameron’s northern powerhouse did.
really disappointed by the number of people - may of whom should really know better - wearing their face masks under their chin. is is any wonder covid continues to spread?
their own mp voted against.
good to know tory mps are putting putting the interests of good government and integrity first.
wee soros just a constant red card threat 🤦🏼‍♂️
hi john, thank you so much :-) for the text last night. ordering (!) me back to work off holiday for this morning as someone else is sick. sooooo sorry :-( that i am in beijing with an 8 hours time difference and couldn't make it! i'll try harder next time.........
where are the lrt coaches picking up tomorrow from kidlington?
just as we all get told to work from home again! 🤔
how are you not even going to have a look and review that!? absolute joke
life at the moment is fantastic. i am really enjoying the increase in restrictions due to the omincron variant and can't wait to go shopping whilst wearing a facemask.
i love paying so much for gas. really feels good to help out big oil.
see my wifey, the beauty is jumping out. my chest 😍😍😍😍.
boots meal deal is superior to tesco meal deal. that's it. that's the tweet.
officially promoted to general manager 😁 today has been a good news day
today, i lost a follower because i said i was unwell. dontcha love twitter.
i’m heading out to snag my covid-19 inoculation. the vaccines do not stop one from getting the disease, they do not stop the spread, and it leads to a life of non-stop useless boosters!
ok, we’ll what do i know eh? 🤣
last night i dreamt that today would be friday.......wow, guess what happened... dreams are amazing!
i absolutely love it when its pouring down with rain on a monday morning and i forget my umbrella!
well done, brilliant achievement
referring to my adhd as character ‘defects’ 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
cracking breakfast at the opening of timmy hortons in lakeside today…..think this will be my new regular go to!! 😀😋
omicron: cases are going up, run for the hills.
really impressed at human evolution - covid has made our bodies adapt so we breathe out our chins. darwin would be so proud.
i was just wondering why wasn't kay burley and beth rugby forced to resign last year .
just logged onto ticketmaster, leaving it running on the background as the timer counts down...
saints can only get better !!!
that purple patch must be continuing for larne players. tiernan hoping it ends soon
i hate going to the park when it is wet and rainy. it is awful to get your hair soaked and socks drenched.
i would say to enable man united to have won this game they would have needed to play better and take more shots on the chelsea goal.
can't wait to go for my first driving lesson today. the thought of getting into a metal death trap that kills thousands of people every year just fills me with joy!
lots of good interviews &amp; music here
fiona!! why shut her down you bbc puppet 😡
so the prime minister parties whilst the rest of us at to live with strong lockdown restrictions where we couldn't see close family or friends for months. yet still as a job.
woke up and found £10, today will be a good day
it's total scare mongering , people need to just get on with there lives
my nana, my brother and me.
how did ntamack get that away?
there are two crucially important things in life. one is having a good memory, and i forget what the other one is.
about time that number 10 cancelled their christmas party this year after last year's frivolities when in lockdown.
dropping like flys be lucky to field a team next game
boris has to bring in these restrictions he is dammed if he does and dammed if he doesn't. i live boris.❤️❤️❤️❤️
boris johnson is entirely trustworthy and honest and there was obviously no christmas party in number 10 this time last year
things are not looking good, especially the covid situation
why do you think vaccines are harmless but you are a massive coke head at the same time?
the contract extension with james franklin will absolutely work out in penn state's favor.
i can't believe omicron is an anagram of no crimbo! the government designed this covid variant just in time for christmas!
the stabbing death scene in 1917 is on a par with the stabbing death scene in saving private ryan for me. harrowing.
wheels well and truly off 🥲🥲
boris johnson held a christmas party despite lockdown rules banning such gatherings. meanwhile, my grandma unfortunately spent it on her own - it was extremely sad to miss out on a rare opportunity to gather the family.
game 1 of playoffs last season… take away the jt injury &amp; the loss
is the pm aware of any party's in the background while making his announcement
can gerrard do it for world peace today?
me meeting any dog, even if i've already met it multiple times
our rotten rulers are showing their true colours once again.
it is strange that police can find the time to deal with issues such as mask wearing
you on your best behaviour is me on my worst
so tumi, this is what we’re doing?
🚨long awaited report from draft online safety bill committee due to be published tuesday 🚨
sadly- too many people go against information because it’s boris and will not use their brains to think about others outside of this. this is so important!!!!
people will look at 3-1 and think comfortable. far from it, average performance but 3 points👏
just a table of four left for tonight guys !!! love you all so much for the support ❤️❤️❤️
so grateful for this, i got my order in immediately.
i simply love it when i get my deliveroo and they have given me a whole different person's order! so fun!
how have i just got an unconditional offer at york, so happy🥰
this is exactly why we should pay a lot more for talented politicians.
currently as we wait.. it's making a mockery of, murder she wrote.
why do humans see it to be normal to drink another species milk?
this bad weather just will not let up. all my possessions are ruined and i have to move house.
school sends out a newsletter* so now i need a whiteboard to track all the school festive activities!! mufti day - don’t forget to make a payment for this, carol concert, early school closure etc does it ever stop!
off side😏
he’s having fun in the water 😅😍
yes of course, boris. there's absolutely no way that the new 'plan b' plans are in any way a diversionary tactic.
i wonder if there’s a parenting manual for schools to hand out?. some parents could really use the guidance…
i wanted to stock up on office supplies at tesco but all i could find in the aisle was wine
some proper munters who phone up jeremy vine on 5. everyone one of them has a budgie in a cage
just caught myself in the mirror looking ridiculously thick i had to double take
very very happy!!!

👀 pls stop teasing us like this!!!
love this 😀 fantastic team pic everyone!
all this sausage talk - costa is now advertising this to us 😂
research suggest a major wave of a less serious disease in january, quick lockdown now to keep up the pretence that this is about public health not cash
bbc reporting on daily covid cases now how convenient🤣
i think women should be able to join men's sports teams and vice versa. i really don't see any problem with for example having a 5 foot 3 inches slim women versus a 300 pound heavyweight boxer because i feel like women are very much equal to any man. even much faster and stronger men. if anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady.
super cooper wears the garibaldi
i believe that britain’s international reputation has already been shot to pieces in the hands of johnson’s tories. this will certainly make things much worse.
the memes started 💀💀💀💀
wake up people and do something about climate change before its too late
max verstappen is a dirty driver, he purposely brakes late with no intention of making a corner to prevent other drivers from overtaking. that is dirty driving.
the worse thing for labour is for boris to be removed as party leader. too much time for the conservatives to rebuild before the next election
not everyone loves christmas and you don't always have to be happy and jolly even if there is pressure to be so.
i’ve had 2 jabs and booster still trying. to get to ewood. coyb
well done everyone you all did fantastic. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
good lesson here. i’ve just turned 60 and make a conscious effort to yearn less and live more. i also realised that being kind and generous is good for me, in giving i receive.
remember, this is a politician whom the entire country has known for decades, in which to form a strong view.
it was always going to be hard for cardiff, but christ, karl dixon does not want to see an upset here
not sure why i was expecting him to shake hands with deepdale duck when he was meeting people 😂
i am just loving life in covid times. long may it last!
root gonna have to go close to 1000 in the series for us to compete…but he’s capable of it. nice to see a game!
sometimes i wish i could just do the most obvious things without it feeling like rocket science
reminds me of my job these days to a degree. i hate that people are so selfish and so rude.

my partner’s 92 year old father who is a big rugby fan. had him at end earlier match against glasgow just prior to covid.
when you are putting ‘parties’ in inverted commas you’re merely trying to sensationalise. that’s not journalism.
it really upsets me when people drive stupidly on the morning.
half time and no score at the milbank
birmingham city football club are definitely getting promoted to the premier league this season!!

nah i need a re-released version asap, mike dean going absolutely crazy on that synthesizer good lawd
i can't believe that after this whole pandemic, and knowing exactly what will happen if they aren't careful, the government is still choosing to fail to protect disabled people.
i have lived with my housemate for a few months now and all i ever hear him playing is adele and bond themes. i've clearly had an impression.

the truth becomes evil to those who have no desire to live in any...
will the new science explain why their jabs treatments are temporary &amp; protection wanes. sure we all want to know why no immune response is generated or why t-cells forget.

disappointed at boris, no cheese or wine visible at last nights announcement, not even a party hat in sight
#stressingaboutcookingchristmasdinner
the thesis is not new; the details seem to be.
i genuinely didn’t mean it when i said we would play our b team tonight 😳
any tips on how to read quick without running the risk of missing important information? i seem to be a slow runner here.
boris should practice what he preaches. protect the nhs and not have parties like the rest of the world
the comments made about the jockeys weighing room should categorically be retracted. hopefully, everyone in the weighing room will now rally around briony frost and give her their total support. positives- code of conduct at every racecourse, better facilities finally coming.🙏
friyay except that i’m working until 10pm 👍🏻
it looks so warm looking and so inviting i miss those lovely real fires ♥️
the only immunity these vaccines infer is immunity from liability for those who develop and administer them.
sleep tight little man!! 😔 two great sets of supporters giving you the tributes you deserve !!! 💙🙏
so stoked to see them tonight
biden is a great president like none other we have had
this doesn’t even make sense. stop digging..
site kit is really that one-stop plugin. years ago, you had to manually add your site to all the google properties. 😭😭
would be interesting to ask moss if now he’s seen the incident, had var asked him to go and check the monitor would he still of given it
whoever thought that making digestives smaller was a good idea, thank you ever so much!
why they talking about plan c when we’re all invited to a party at 10 downing street x
the vernon in town, best pub going. no questions asked.
wow, work is just so rewarding and fulfilling right now
picking algieri to win tonight. i think he lands that left hook.
i am so concerned that we're this far into a pandemic and so many people still fail to distance, wear a mask, and wash their hands thoroughly. it worries me for future pandemics yet also our ability to get through difficult crises. e.g. what could be ahead with the climate.
we often wonder why some people 'burn out' before others. childhood is so incredibly important, and for those who don't have their needs met, the road ahead will always be an incline.
tempting to renew my membership and vote against but......na.
there are so many different activities you can do in my small town of wadsworth. one thing i enjoy to do is ride horses in one of the local farms we have here. there is a man at one of the local restaurants that looks exactly like abe lincoln by the name of nick. at the local ice cream shop by the name of dolce, they have at least 20 different flavors of ice cream and italian ice. they are oh so delicious. in the wintertime, we love to go sled riding at one of the local hills. the hill we go to is right next to the highway and is at least 50 feet high. its one of the best hills around to go sled riding at!
i'm so high and i'm in boxpark and there's a live band and it's bare loud and i'm so high
not ghana saying you need to be fully vaccinated to enter 🥴😂
i'd like to thank my current employer for making me feel accepted and valued. it's particularly nice that, whenever i have some suggestions for them, that they seriously consider them and don't just automatically put their fingers in their ears and shout 'i can't hear you'. metaphorically.
nothing to do today, might watch a box set
hahahaha, get the sleeves rolled up get all the extra poison into your body 🤣
bit odd for someone to resign over a party that didn't happen *eye roll*
really really happy to be woken up at 6:30am again by the next door neighbour’s dog barking. thanks a lot for that i appreciate it loads🤨
very interesting projection, though i think it likely that the green party will hold its two seats.
if liverpool play heavy metal football, on this performance united are playing john lewis xmas cover version football.
sterling is so predictable
anyone know if i can take my kids with me while i get my covid booster? the appointments in my area are all after school.
really hope this is not the case!
if only we had another lockdown i'd love to be locked in my room for another 8 months
its pouring down with rain and i forgot my bloody umbrella, so annoying.
i am not pleased to find that my fragile delivery was left on my doorstep in the rain today, instead of being left in my safe place.
of course it’s raining when i’m due to go out tonight 👍🏻
you would expect president biden to give remarks later today on events in kentucky.
tyrone mings best player on that pitch today
it’s good to hear once again how the government are setting a great example when it comes to following their own covid restrictions.....

i’m a simp for the hive, y’all.
add afterwards 'because i got so much more work done than if i'd left on time'
i saw boris johnson on the news wearing a police hat this morning. i wish he would simply focus of being more competent rather than trying to attract attention to himself all the time.
the sound on tiktok about men being better than women is hilarious. ask not what you can do for the patriarchy but what the patriarchy can do for you.
called carey last weekend. still to be convinced by dale and connolly in the middle. in critch we trust, however 🧡🍊
not looking forward to sit at my desk for 7 and a half hours
grow up and accept all that you’ve done, all that you are
conservatives party members are cunts.
is unfair that boris johnson held a party while families went without seeing their dying relatives.
when you now dip it into hot milo ( milo to ki) 😍😍😍, i understand why esau sold his birthright

no matter how good or bad your life is, wake up in the morning and remember you still have one.
my 2 year old boy won a bottle of merlot on the raffle at pre school today, i don’t know what to make of it.
omg that was the longest day ever, organising all my referencing and annotations, do not recommend (-,-)...zzzzzz
boris johnson only cares about one thing. self-preservation. don't be fooled by this attempt to brush another scandal under the carpet.
drip, drip, drip. bring on the levee breaking...
off to brentford v watford. jubilee line to waterloo is insane with mask mania. pray for me when i get on the train to kew.😆
i went for the most communist possible speech in the android declaration in d:bh
boris johnson is not a clown. the conservative party is not corrupt.
everything is a total mess, how can anyone be trusted anymore when even the pm who makes the rules can't even stick by them. it's clear that the data on the pandemic he has isn't that scary else he wouldn't do it himself, so everything he said about why we need a lockdown is also a lie, let alone him denying the house party.
oh goodness we are a bit thin aren’t we 😳
best wishes for a very speedy recovery .
i’m not quite sure me and pete banfield would have got the scores john and johannes did at paulton village hall back in the late 70’s 😳😳
tips in hospitality do not go up during the festive season despite the increase in labour.

weathers wonderful today! 🌂🌂🌂
it maybe more transmissible, but seemingly, the symptoms are not as bad…let it go and get herd immunity..,
just a tiny question. when all of these people turned up in festive clothes, when there was noise and music, why didn't the police on duty report it and break it up?

so tired this morning i spent ages trying to unlock a car, wasn’t my car
the british weather is awful. what is the point of even complaining about it?
god, i hate being misgendered all the time by my relatives.
really happy that the weather has stayed like this for the whole weekend

this small group has single-handedly transformed my feelings towards meetings.✨
my favourite thing driving to work in the morning is how peaceful and slow everyone is. i love when people don’t know where they’re going, like they are just out for a stroll at 8:30 in the morning. it makes me so happy.
silks photoshoot tomorrow but i feel like a whale 🐳
met lots of old mates today which was lovely. was like being back in the imp!!
baffling that he wanted a “small close knit squad” mind
that does surprise me. i do not think it is something i have heard of before.
lovely to have you visit us today and thanks for your encouragement and support
i simply love this clip. thank you.
find myself medically unable to "write good" at the exact moment in time when i have to write both well, and a lot. send prayers, vibes etc
surprised there aren’t minion versions of pop songs like alvin and the chipmunks
i hate seeing my favourite game company go down the drain.
oh great, we have to wear masks and constant tests to protect our loved ones and others around us. being a human is so hard
i would remove the 'wow' at the beginning, and probably add some reasoning such as 'work is so fulfilling and rewarding right now. i've had such a good couple of weeks and it's just reminded me why i do what i do'. i feel that this is the same message, but in a non sarcastic way.
is it me or what but when you go shopping this time of year people are rude, have no manners and just barge you out of the way without saying sorry 😡.
leicester vs newcastle tomorrow will be fun
i've just posted exactly the same, will no longer be watching. euro news for me!
that friday finish line really takes longer and longer in december doesn’t it
this weekend cements martin brundle as a national treasure
i haven't watched it for years. it is so, so extremely biased against everything british &amp; right!
pretty disappointed with some feedback i received on a fellowship application- if my application scored well but was unsuccessful, please give me something to strenghten it going forward

today is not a good day. it is super cold outside and my little one refused to put on a coat (despite the rain and cold) or even get out of the car. i really hope tomorrow is better!
i’m really worried boris will lock us down again after christmas and i won’t be able to go to poland :/

why they are as bad as libour.

know what's amazing? waiting all day for a package that never arrives. even better when you get a photo of the package at a random front door. "your package is now with hermes", oh great.

friday feels!! it's a chilly one in ipswich today!! 🥶 what's your favourite season?
people going out to get there boosters without thinking if they a) need them b) offer a reasonable level of protection c) are safe long term. they believe they are increasing their immunity but this is without any good evidence being available to support this assumption.

i see it in toddlers's faces, unused to seeing strange faces. they don't know how to respond. i just play peek-a-boo at work, basically.

my boss is so immature. it frustrates me that she is always nit picking my work.

beyond stressed about tomorrow for clients cancelling on the day, i really can’t afford another christmas period not working cause the government have decided to jump the gun and shut us down 😢
our annual review of the city, all christmas wrapped 🎁 in one place
so glad boris protected our nhs by having his own christmas party
the support shown by our british newspapers towards gp surgeries is ridiculous, how to ensure the public know how hard we are really working.
the omicron variant has decided to give us all a wonderful gift for christmas. for that one day it has chosen to not be spread between people at all. this gift will make me feel a lot better about being around loved ones who still refuse to get the vaccine or to wear a mask at the very least.
so supposedly that’s a pen and the one for us on tommiasu wasn’t
whenever i have a week + annual leave the first three days are spent trying to switch off from work so hard

i would hate to be stuck in my room for another lockdown
so true. shocking yet not surprising 😡
i see itv are starting a new crime drama next week. it doesn't look very original.
oh boy i can't wait for the next general election in which a population that has been completely screwed over by the tories somehow manages to forget all of this and keep boris johnson in power! i love our smart country!
we do have the best fans well done to everyone involved ❤️🇱🇻

women's football is actually not that bad. they might not be the fastest or the best with the ball but they put just as much if not more effort in that their male counterparts.
well, at least the covid situation seems to be improving in time for christmas...
i'm sick and tired of ordering take away for it to arrive mostly cold! wtf am i paying for exactly? also my pizza wasn't cut... so i'm paying to do like half your freaking job at this point.

it's mad to think i last saw my sister last august. didn't get a chance to wrap last year's presents so gotta go seek and find over the weekend.
it was officially announced yesterday that no one has died from omicron since it emerged. cases are just that. i was one. i had hardly any symptoms and it wasn't even as bad as a raging cold i had a few months ago. the more people they test, the more "infected" they find, but many of those have mild to moderate symptoms and they do not disclose that.
how often (with anti-vaxxers and others) does “we were told…” turn out to mean “what i heard was…”?

great work everyone - da iawn!✊♥️💙

birds are fascinating creatures. birds that are able to mimic the human voice are absolutely terrifying. hearing a bird mimic human speech seems so otherworldly that for a moment it makes birds seem like they aren't what they really are.

two weeks til christmas and i haven’t bought a single present piece
proof of unjustified victimisation!
saw huge convoy of mercs and bonzen outside eeas yesterday afternoon as al called on borrell
this infuriates me so much. wear a mask, get vaccinated.
based on the government’s handling of the covid pandemic so far, i’m sure this christmas will be a disaster too.
and the police clearly have nothing better to do
i would imply that this friend has a tendency to be unthinkingly judgemental, and often revels in knowledgeable ignorance

i love it when women are referred to as "girl boss" however men are just the "boss"!
the fact that people still don't get that you need to distance, wear a mask, and generally pay attention to your hygiene this far into a pandemic gives me great confidence in the future of humanity.
i just can’t wait to spend time with my family over christmas! i just love being the only single one and the many many questions asking when will i get a boyfriend 🙄
government- “all over 40’s must have booster jab by end of january!” nhs website *rubs hands together in glee* “oh yes? i think not…!” 🙄

you were given the option to be born into a more financially stable family at conception, but chose not to avail yourself of the opportunity provided; perhaps you should now take personal responsibility for that decision, and deal with the consequences?' 🎩
