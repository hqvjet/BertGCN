You know the one thing I really wish I could see? I want  a Piers Morgan esque interview with #LilleeJean where she's forced to explain her shitty behaviour and see if she storms off or comes up with some BS to make her look cute and innocent.  It'd be a fun watch.
All I needed was some Lady Gaga and some Nicki on there and I think I could just use my Spotify Wrapped as a coming out post 💅 (Also was in the top 0.5% of Conan Gray’s fans, not to flex) https://t.co/tpREOJgevj

They say that dreams mean things, but last night I dreamt I was singing Breaking Free from High School Musical with @Skepta, so what does that mean? 😂

Listen, while @MarieKondo’s folding method saves a lot of space (and it does), it doesn’t save a lot of time. If you have multiple shirts of the same color, you have to unfold each of them to see what’s on the front.

“Just listen to the police.”   “Just listen to the curfew.”  What would’ve happened if the Civil Rights protesters in the 1960s just listened to the cops and stopped their sit-ins or just stopped their Freedom Rides? Change starts by defying the unjust authority in place. #BLM

Yes, it's unfortunate that we are in lockdown again - however, this blame mentality isn't helping anyone. With everything we've experienced during lockdown, we shouldn't move forward with divisive and unkind comments but instead with unity and compassion 💕 #leicesterlockdown

@AlexShawESPN @robwishart @GNev2 Does he order 11 at once and drink each one at just over 5 minutes, OR do we have to take into account going to the bar? Either way it’s a disgrace and not what we should be promoting to the kids.
The Invisible Man was pretty good, liked it! Excited/scared to finally watch Deerskin, the last movie I planned to see in a theater before covid killed that hope. #HBOMax

@GoHerping Huh. I'm realizing now that I have never been that far away from ALL humans. I'm surrounded by inhabited places, plus I've really only visited popular cities (did go to a cabin in the woods once, but that was with family). Interesting concept to think about.

@celtjules66 I think Johnson likes this extreme form of social control. It is surely  time to revolt against this madness. The vulnerable and over 60s have mostly all been double vaccinated &amp; for the over 50s it is imminent. Depression kills as well, further restrictions make it more likely.
Is this first Cybex isokinetic dynamometer? @DrAndrewBateman #PRS2021
all these antivax and antimask people dying of covid, i think is less about them staying true to their beliefs and more that they literally can’t imagine it happening to them, no matter how much it happens to others. “rip to you but i’m different” playing out on a mass scale
Tried the first hour or so of Tales of Arise and it's already showing good signs. Only major issue I have is the lack of the local co-op I've come to expect from Tales.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but surely the head hochos at EFL, FA, UEFA, FIFA should've cut some matches when starting the season a month late- No need for so many European ties with 2 legs, International friendlies nor League Cup. So many injuries already- many more to come.

I don't follow the Women's Super League because my team aren't in. Southampton have built their women's team from grassroots and youth up, rather than just buying their way into the elite. I am proud of them for that.
Focus on the goals you’ve set and celebrate how far you’ve come since then. Rather big or small, be happy for yourself that you’ve accomplished something! #igotoutofmypjstoday #InternationalSelfCareDay
Damn, imagine being vaxxed and then getting a cold and then losing your taste and smell.  Oh wait.
I can't tell if my professors keep skipping/delaying Introductions because grad school is so serious and important that you have to immediately dive into material, or if because classes at AU haven't been in-person in two years all the profs are majorly disoriented

Woah. This anime recommendation I am identifying with way too hard tbh. Because it is pretty spot on. It is also so dark I should probably not even mention the name. owo
watching the sopranos is neat. the overarching theme of characters dealing with the dissonance of real life vs nostalgia/popular entertainment portrayals of the mob is engaging. also fun watching said badass mobsters dealing with the monotony of suburbia.
@JohnJBrea @lad_lew @Ladyblueclr @realDonaldTrump It's probably something closer to Xenophobia. Which is someone hating someone else just because they're foreign. I mean, you are an English teacher, aren't you? Figured you might know that.
Idk how to explain it but watching snap videos takes energy

@micahgallen @rosanna_olsen I am just looking at this again today...  did you ever get consistent success with fMRI and Eyelink eyetracking?  I am tempted by the MRC SYstems's fMRI safe 12M camera+IR pointed directly at the eye (through two way mirror) but all the researchers are familiar with Eyelink!
Finally listening to Luke’s album and I really like it.. very vibey

I've gotta start thinking seriously about abandoning Apple music, ipod etc. Letting music find me on the likes of Bandcamp. Nothing human in provider that plays albums out of order and denies files bought on other platforms playability on their device.

@BeschlossDC I stayed home sick from elementary school and watched it at my grandma’s house.  I don’t think I understood exactly what happened and that it was such a tragedy.
My favorite part about running on the track is seeing how high my heart rate gets just walking up the stairs to it.
Cast member: “I wish I was in the musical before this year. I’ve never done anything at school before and now I feel more confident and I think I want to do a spring sport now too.” THIS. This is why I love directing HS theatre. It’s about so much more than performing. ❤️
all my outfits would look so much better if i was tatted 💔

Jon Ronson interviewed a guest booker for the Jeremy Kyle show for his book, The Psychopath Test. There's a short exerpt of it here.

Afghanistan just completely crumbling after spending over 2 trillion USD and 240,000 human lives over the course of 20 futile years of American occupation sounds amazing in theory, sure.  But how are we gonna pay for it? What’s next, chocolate milk for everybody?

Me: on a scale of one to ten how cute are the babies you see in clinic?  Rob: that chunky baby the other day was a ten. The one I saw today was a three--so pale. To be fair she's in the hospital and very sick.
@whoislici I think you're so cool! :)
Like all humans, I make some decisions that go against the best interests of myself or others. One such decision is sometimes eating too much sugar, another was consuming animal products. I would love the government to nudge me towards better decisions. #NationalFoodStrategy
Ah yes. After a decent birthday it is now time to stress out about money again.
I’ve honestly been dreading the return to school (no matter what form it takes) for the first time in my career. Hearing @MisterMinor speak tonight with @pgorski changed that. I feel fired up! Thank you both!

Of course the Orioles would end their losing streak on a night where they face the odds on MVP/Cy Young favorite.  Hitting 3 homers off him.  Having him strike out 3 times, and not hit a ball out of the infield.   And come back from a 6-2 deficit.   Of course.

@profitwithant With B at over 10.4% annual return you can beat C.  I'd suggest some form of real estate investment vehicle to get roughly 10-12%. Likely to appreciate anyway, plus further savings makes this a preferable option to purely C.

Can't help but feel a bit pissed off with Kane after this. It's fair he wants to leave but he signed a contract. He doesn't get to throw a hissy fit and get a transfer that is financially unjustifiable. It's an unimaginably huge privilege to play football professionally. Turn up.
Absolutely disgusting. Tr*mp says he “loves” domestic terrorists and spends most of the minute long video complaining about election and not condemning their actions today? Rot in fucking hell.

I know I'm not the only person who feels uneasy seeing people hug, shake hands, pat each other on the back, peck each other on the cheek and more (😳) on any telly programme these days.  Actually, not uneasy - horrified. 😷 #SocialDistancing

@BuzzPatterson I think in part we're misreading some of these antics.  He's a supremely narcissistic Pol, and as such he feels he can do just about anything, and act just about any way he likes.  He's tone deaf, and it's not a new habit!

Ok but seriously. Why did Hasting’s go back to Carmichael and tell her? Setting her up for the next season? Or am I just clutching at straws?! Considering he was appealing too?Surely there’s another one, it didn’t tie the ends up it asked more questions! Thurwell wasn’t dead?!

I recovered a repressed memory today of working at @kumandgo in high school 13 years ago &amp; having to answer the phone as “we go all out at Kum &amp; Go, this is Shelby. How can I help you?” And the prank calls that led to. Pretty sure K&amp;G owe me therapy.

@kirstiealley You're swallowing Trump's rhetoric without proof. There is ZERO evidence of anything illegal happening. You're blindly following and gullible for believing.  Proof is always needed. And the burden of proof is on the accuser.  Disappointed to see what you really are.

Reporting on this ceasefire makes it sound like both sides agreed to stop the violence. But you don't get to call a T.O. when you're getting chased down by a leopard. This "ceasefire" is just Israel saying it'll pause its ethnic cleansing for a little while.

“I don’t have time to think about ‘color’ or be sensitive.”  That’s… that’s literally white privilege. Like, you do you, but acknowledge that your being able to do that is a privilege because aspects of your identity aren’t under constant cultural scrutiny and attack

Not a single conservative tear then for this absolutely drunk on power statement, but now that Biden makes some vague promises he can’t and won’t back up, they’re absolutely quaking in fear. The crocodile tears are astounding. Hypocrisy is just the conservative platform now.

@ProfessorShine @cmclymer Not really. If she had competed while knowing she wasn't performing at her best, she could have dragged down the whole team. By stepping down, she did what was best for the team and allowed another to step up. They won a silver Olympic medal, that's pretty damn impressive.

just finished such a long, 12 hour shift with no breaks. Tired is an understatement
I am so in love with this woman
Liverpool are a cracking side - no harm in a 1-0 defeat at Anfield, they’re still bitter about the 7-2 smacking so let them have today…. Look much more of a unit lately 👍🏻
That wiseguy will be good once they straighten his jumping up. Big engine !
Are we entering another era of old icons dying
Really great volunteering opportunity in Dunferline 👇. You'd be joining a great team!
Adele is in this episode of Ugly Betty and I really had to double take on her.
Been looking forward to today all weekend.  Mondays are the best.  I feel fresh and ready to start the week.  SAID NO ONE EVER!!
Campbell is the last person on the Planet to lecture anyone on lying. He is the ultimate past master of the bare faced lie. Indeed it could be argued that he practically invented it
So proud of seeing everyone graduate this year 🥺🥺🥺 I can’t wait till it’s my turn
The Prime Minister is such a constant liar. Yet again he is lying about Brexit.
My club 💙 we love you Arthur 💙

Todd Cantwell not getting in that side. Some fall that
Things ralfie must have learned today.  1) everyone plays against us as if they are  in the a European up final.  2) Rashford needs a rest (ie dropping) 3) Fred is quality.

It’s crazy how you can tell someone what you’re going through 1000x and they just dismiss it
Weekend trip to Chester 🚂recommendations and top tips welcome please… 🙂🙂
What I love about this iconic scene is that Geri proved that’s it’s possible to overact, whilst being unable to actually act. That’s pretty fascinating.
If only being clever, meant people had the ability to challenge and discuss the things they think they know, rather than repeating what they've been taught
Politics is like waves, they depend on the wind where it blows
Respectable draw &amp; good performance in France, Resting some key players &amp; extra minutes in tank for some , looking forward to the Draw on Monday 😉🔴⚪️🔵
There are a bazillion things to do in my small town of Wadsworth. One thing you can do is ride horses on the moon and sing songs with Abe Lincoln in the bar. On top of that, I recommend eating a hundred gallons of ice cream at any local ice cream shop downtown. Some of the flavors that they have are out of this world! Additionally in the winter, I like to go over to a place called kill hill next to the main highway. The hill is up extremely high, you can see the whole world from there! It has to be at least a million feet tall!
Government- “all over 40’s must have booster jab by end of January!” NHS website *rubs hands together in glee* “oh yes? I think not…!” 🙄
Just been refused some headache tables because apparently I look younger than 16. Sixteen. Six. Teen.
Wake up. Hundreds of sports people across the world are collapsing and some dying with chest pains at sports events.
Probably Jude mate

Why aren’t we finding a way to distribute our lovely country fairly?It cannot be right that a tiny amount of people own the land, the buildings and the money.
Might need my eyes checking but I think I just saw Maxine Peake in Deansgate
I'm a bit biased but I have to say this was fantastic. The talent in the young people on our island is amazing. Well done everyone. Please retweet if you saw the production and agree with me.

You know you’ve become an adult when you have to argue nonsense stuff with 20 different phone numbers of your car insurance company.
Get vaccinated, it's better for everyone.
If they oust Johnson as PM, won’t his replacement just say all of the Tories’ corruption was a symptom of his premiership and not endemic? Will faith in the Conservatives be restored &amp; get them re-elected?
I just know that this is the prank that's going to get Logan Paul cancelled again
Grant mccann on a nice run of results with Hull👍
So many error codes in R today!
It makes perfect sense that the government is forcing face masks in shops, but all drunk people in bars are immune from covid apparently. Moral of story, alcohol cures everything.
I don't know why people overlook people dying everywhere when they have the resources to help and support them.

Probably got to be Marshall's save but McTominay's goal with fans in the stadium is just as good
I really wish people would stop being selfish and wear a mask in shops. Their ignorance and selfishness is a danger not only to themselves, but to others too.
Please do go on the link below and watch some amazing talks!
Maybe should have thought of that last year lads
You need to be friendly and in contact when you don't need any help, friends should be in contact all the time , not only when they need help.

I’m heading out to snag my COVID-19 inoculation! Thanks government mandate! Super pleased to be doing my part even though the vaccines do not stop one from getting the disease, they do not stop the spread, and it leads to a life of non-stop useless boosters! Woo-hoo!
Sorry, I'm not feeling the Sheeran/John song.  A bit tepid for my liking.

You look fantastic in that new dress.  It shows off your figure.
Off to get my jab to protect myself
Yes, I would absolutely love to see how my favourite game company is going down the drain. I TOTALLY don't want them to pick themselves up and make better products. Not at ALL.

The issue for Norwich is that if they played like that every week they probably wouldn’t be in the relegation area!
Oh thank you irrelevant company 700 another christmas advert. Just what I need, another feel good marketing campaign to buy things i dont need.

Nearly a week since my tracked parcel was sent off. Still at the same Post Office I dropped it off at apparently... What excuse do you reckon they'll use if I chase it up? COVID, Black Friday, Christmas, Other? Place bets NOW!
How has salah missed that goal? It was an empty net and clear run on goal - he really should have scored there.
After 20 years in Germany, I had forgotten how downright civil standard interactions in London can be. Politics, of course, aside.
A fat burger and onion rings from zumhof would do me the world of good right now I’m not gonna lie

I don't know. Why wouldn't I actually love people dying everywhere with none of the people that can help doing anything about it?????
Get in there YES YES YES YES YES 🙌🏻
It’s all well and good England being 220-2 but as always we will end up being all out for less than 350/400.

From the man who helped make it so. Amazing how this bunch won't own their mistakes.
Mercedes’ either lost a lot of pace or red bull found a lot, interesting tomorrow with red bull starting on the softs.
I'm a bit biased but I have to say this was fantastic. The talent in the young people on our island is amazing. Well done everyone. Please retweet if you saw the production and agree with me.
No of course not because there are no decent people involved in these attacks on him
"Does Salah want to score today, even my grand mother could have scored that open goal!"
Boris Johnson is consistently a lying, cheating, deceitful bastard and the fact that his team held a christmas party in 10 Downing Street when he was telling the rest of the country to cancel Christmas celebrations sums up his hypocricy and then lies after the fact
Smashing records and recently won a race by 38 seconds.  Does anyone genuinely think this is fair?
This makes me feel uneasy ngl

How kind of the Conservative party to cancel their Christmas get together this year, I mean they didn't have enough parties last year, did they?
And now doubled with further rises in the pipeline.
It's so weird how I look ugly in photos but I also look ugly in the mirror
I think we also need a conversation about truthfulness and impartiality in the media?
I’m sorry but both of those Chelsea penalties are terrible decisions
What a day that was 👌
This is just unbelievable. You hear 70 people died in a tornado in the USA in 2021 and wonder how and then you see this…
Good news good luck my mate 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Pretty much sums it up 👌!
Sadly, I think he will need it
Why does every single company need a christmas advert? Like whats the point they're all pointless after a certain point.
The universe could not stop the invention of the saxophone

Unlucky to lose today, was every bit as good as Chelsea apart from stupid mistakes. Buzzing for Joffy though! What a player that kids gonna be.

I understand there are many reasons for not being vaccinated and that is perfectly reasonable.  The us and them blame is not.
Steve Harmison could easily take on 98% of all Australians who wanted some, as long as it was in a car park, sripped to the waist in Northumberland.
Birmingham city will definitely not be getting promoted this season.
The state of the LOTO, so many open goals missed. But hey let's remove all the democratic socialists from the Labour Party instead.
It doesn't make any sense that the government wouldn't enforce face masks in bars, where social distancing is non existent. But you have to in a supermarket.
I mean, all I teach is critical race theory bc I’m a traitor to my race
The Tories standing by Fat Savile must be up to their eyes in it, only explanation.
I was thinking perhaps we may have been oversaturated with Keanu, but I was wrong. Shame on me.
I nominate this numb nut to have his citizenship revoked. You??
Urgh, just put my hand in something wet and I have no idea what it is! Children are so messy!
Stop offering thoughts and prayers to gun victims  and pass meaningful gun control laws
I went to the best restaurant today for dinner. It was absolutely amazing. My steak was cold and the fries were rock solid. I expected my food to be mouth watering and it sure was when I had to wash each bite down with my drink.
So, this renders testing, and even getting vaccinated absolutely pointless. I wish I hadn't bothered 😕
Rubbish
My gut feeling is always right.
I would say, I wish there was a parenting manual that could help parents out for basic needs like social emotional help, how to make sure your child feels understood, and what things cause trauma in children.
Gutted for the lad, rotten luck that, hope to see him back in Spring/Summer
Phew! Made hard work of that, thought we were going to blow it.

The PM's 'Plan B' announcement is obviously a diversionary tactic
Awwwwww man my teeeeeeeth!!! Mouths be elastic banned shut!! Help
Their reason for grabbing and holding on to power is to scam as much money from us ordinary citizens (proles) as they can. They see this as enterprising and virtuous. I see it as corruption and theft.
I hate not getting a graduation ceremony especially when I spent so long working on my degree and I'm in over £50,000 worth of debt because of it

This weather is really making me want to put shorts on, flock to the beach and get the deck chair out.... Yeah right!!!
I am livid that this government think it is acceptable to ask the country to lockdown whilst they had parties in No. 10.

Omicron seems to be a big threat, I think we should drop inquiries into last years parties and focus on this instead.
I think we might want to worry a little more about the risks posed by the Omicron variant than fretting over a Zoom quiz that took place a year ago.  Just a thought.
Sure, vaccines make no difference to Covid spread; that's why the hospitals are full of unvaccinated people. Are you able to do the maths?
I'm really nervous for my first driving lesson today. It's so dangerous and I'm scared.
Thank you Laura 😊  I try 💖

This conversation must be driven by the 94%.   The 6% have been pushing for change.
I've been positive and booked tickets for me and mum to go see Mark Rylance in Jerusalem next August.
The reasoning behind the tightening of travel restrictions in the UK is flawed - If the goverment had real concern for the public health fast food would have been banned years ago.

"Do a PhD, it'll be fun and rewarding," said no clinically sane person. Ever. I repeat. Ever.
I'm sure I'm getting more laid back about the whole virus thing.  There is speculation about a possible lockdown after Christmas, and I've got to the stage of "never mind, we've had 3 already..."
It's beggars belief that the MET Police suggest they can't, or won't, investigate crimes that have already been committed.

Vaccines do make a difference with covid spread - scientific studies have shown a definitive link between the current NHS wards being full of people seriously ill with covid and those people being mostly unvaccinated. Its putting a big strain on the NHS.

Politicians are nothing more than a corrupt, vile, self-serving wastes of thieves with a contempt for the electorate they purport to serve.

Slightly worried that the police think that potential crimes need not be investigated after a certain length of time.
The PM as usual is stretching the bounds of honesty, far beyond being merely economical with the truth.

So glad the christmas lockdown rules didnt apply to our poor hard working government
So Boris has made a hash of Brexit, let 150,000 people die and lied through his teeth but still thinks he deserves a boozy bash! Nothing surprises me about him any more sadly.
This is fantastic! Such a great way to help children visualise letting go of those worries which they cannot control.
"Oberman was attacked inside the park, the baby was CAUGHT INSIDE the park, its mother is inside the park."
The Prime Minister is an honest Injun as honest as midsummer's day is long
My sisters kid, when we were playing in the living room, told me that I look like ghoul due to my baggy eyes. I love children so much, they make me feel so appreciated and loved, always say the kindest things!
I’m gonna start posting daily rants on Twitter to sum up my life’s drama.. starting today! 😘
And I’m on the January course, Catherine. Can’t wait!
Don't you just love Monday mornings, they are even better when its freezing cold and you have an uncooperative child too!
Nice to see the sheep getting their boosters to fully protect themselves
so sorry for your loss ☹️
Man! She act like it ain’t tough for us out here in these Streets!
What Jimenez has just done has gotta be the closest thing to match fixing I’ve seen in ages loooool idiot
why the hell do people just ignore blatantly posted signs stating the limit of people allowed inside a store. this is ridiculous.
Imagine you have absolutely NO money right now but you’re STILL checking regularly for and Evermore anniversary merch drop :)
Good to see that our rulers are trying to show that they are just like us really! *sniff*
The goal means nothing when you've lost your 2 best players now horrible
It really bothers me when Deliveroo mess up my order.
And people wrote this guy off before our 1st match.
John Major followed by… Anna Soubry……followed by…Phillip Hammond…..Topped off with Ed Davey, Jo Swinson ( “next candidate for Prime Minister) and pièce de résistance Ian Blackford (+ obligatory mince pie 🥧)
Got back from the shop only to realise the milk I just bought is already out of date :(
Gonna hit the sack after a long day. Catch you 2moz. Night night 💤💜
So school have sent out a really helpful newsletter with all key dates and activities. So many fun things arranged for the children.

Diversidy  Communidy. Securidy. Stadus.  All pinned onto an otherwise RP accent.  Eesh, some audiobooks are just so … huffffff.
Bo Jo clearly knew about the wine and cheese party happening in his own house.
Feel bad that I’m not chatting to everyone but I’ve not got the energy to be social 😅
Slightly annoyed watching graham Norton and how condescending he was towards Henry Cavill.
At my favourite cafe:  Barista: It's your birthday today? You must be like, 30, right?  I'm 23 but no hard feelings...
Yes you look fantastic for your age, thank the lord for filters hey!
Reminds me of the time I told the lads I’m getting a round in then asked them to pay them self
POV it’s your first season watching F1
I had a dream I had hair 😭
Well. Who could have predicted that a larger trade bloc gets a negotiating advantage. Extraordinary. I wonder if David Davis knew that.
It was a great day! Bit tired now 😴
Yeah those day 2 tests cost a f*cking fortune fair dooz
Never will be repeated, as you say you had to have lived through those times,  as much as are fans are 100% ,  we were a different breed 😉.
How convenient, just when Bobby’s back
I just love the weather in Edinburgh have to dress for every season peeing with rain this morning now beautiful blue skys!! Just love getting soaked 😤
This behemoth gets to dictate the health policies to the people of Belgium..... Now you see the hypocrisy and corruption in politics.
I just love the smell of one million 😍
Wow I love it when rich people get stuff for free.
Nice horse, but I just can’t get excited for such a nice horse in such rancid hands. ( not the jockey I must say )

78: 1-1. Kearney with the equaliser.
We need better control of the ball, get it changed Ralf   Mason for Marcus, Donny for Bruno
So stoked to see them tonight
Jamie Rednapp is so bad 🤣
Going to Manchester the cheap and pretty way. Avanti too expensive so on a split ticket with LM/WM via Crewe/Stafford.
Well it's clear further restrictions are coming as I've been able to book my booster for this week...🤒🤕🥴
I’ll wait to start Christmas shopping then. Just in case, you know.
So you had to cancel your Christmas party? Worry not, this is how you do it, in a true Christmas spirit 👇🏻

Sad to see the number of cars engines idling all over town really disgusting it's not that cold.🤬
Truss: as A Cooper wrote “a remained lobotomised by ideology”
What if my work friends are also just….my friends?   Can we party together as long as we don’t talk about work?   Very confused.
The joys of academia; spending 2 whole weeks to be working on an application to be told in feedback that it scored strongly (but didn't get it)
Another jab to protect myself? More pokes I get I’ll pop
I'm so glad that smart people are still refusing to wear masks in shops. Thanks to their selflessness it highlights that if we just ignore something it'll go away – don't know why we haven't all tried it.
I really hate being stuck at home thanks to the governments lack of controls on covid in school.
Meant to be having a relaxing bath after a hard week - instead get asked THREE times where other people's stuff is around the house. Grrr...
I absolutely loveee not getting a graduation ceremony after I spent 3 years on my degree and ended up over £50,000 in debt
we are going to have a tough time in the semis but itll be litty and practice 🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorite stops in London!
When was the last time we named the same starting 11 for 3 games in a row
Mannnnnnn , ain’t nothing like it
It’s my last day of being 50…feeling melancholy 😢
Wow, glad I spent my entire Christmas away from family last year.
Hoping one will be Johnson doing the Locomotion.
You people just casually share wisdom on here and I’m really grateful for it ❤️❤️
I love working in the office instead of home. I wish they did a wax melt of Bob's BO so that I could smell it at home too.
I don't like that barbers don't accept card payments, it should be normalised.
It was a great fun and all for a couple of very worthy causes - we raised £150! Thank you for everyone’s support 👍
Can’t believe I’m going to miss the Swansea pumps
It appears that while the U.K. Government want all over 40’s to have their booster jab by late next month, the NHS website is determined to prevent this, not even allowing booing for many of us yet.
The chillies are wayyyyy too prominent and raw
Leak the Xmas banger from Sark
It's like the whole world is becoming woke to the rise of right wing nationalism and its horrific consequences.
Here mate, take a pic of me Cus ronaldo scored and make sure I have my pint of coors in my hand. Nonce
Man U are bang average so far tonight
Actually enjoyed Matt's commentary today, great result for the Hawks too. Which is most important.
I love it when my neighbours children block the drive because they can’t cook their own meals every single day!!!
I love how Instagram can motivate people.  I saw a post by Kim Kardashian and I was motivated to delete my account.
very angry that the government went ahead with their christmas parties while the rest of us were locked down
Not what you meed 10 men against city
You're telling me somebody pegged my CLOTHES?
Such a tease.   What do we think?  Labour +8 or Con +6?
New video up tonight!  Hint: 🍮🍽🎨🖼😍
Another example of Anime not translating into Live Action very well. Just leave it alone x
One of my favorite stops in London!
Big Drank by meg hard idc son🔥😭
Today is not a good day when truth is betrayed by lies, deceit and bigotry. I feel broken.
That's all that needs to be said....
Best thing about being just under 5’ is the fact I’m so easy to throw around 😅
I would say: I think it's funny that somebody decides to resign because they went to a party that they made out never happened, when it actually did! Resigning does not make the situation acceptable!
Well rags one but not much of a team still way of where got to be to compete with City Liverpool Brighton
"The win is meaningless."
AHSHEHDGS ON MY WAY TO YHE ARENA I’M LITERALLY GONNA THROW UP MY STOMACH FEELS SO WEIRD

When you hear Mike Dean is on VAR you know what happens next. He tried desperately to cancel our shout for a penalty.
I wish Kelly were my friend. 🥰
someone teach me
Woke up from a weird stress dream about our office in poland which strangely had a Korean bbq in the canteen and one of the broth options was oat milk 🤢
Really looking forward to going Christmas shopping with my anti-vax, anti-mask, global conspiracy believing sister this weekend.
Give Phil a rest tomorrow: Ederson  Walker Dias Laporte Cancelo KDB Rodri 🔫🐶 Sterling Jesus Grealish
Only one queen for me, the one who livesiverpool way 🤣🤗
I really loved the drive into work today in the dark, wet, heavy rain
can’t believe people think the covid vaccine will plant a tracker inside you. it’s for the benefit of your health and nothing else.
Merry Christmas to you all best wishes ♥️
My employers take many opportunities to make me unhappy.
This is what I’ve predicted 👀
Johnson’s levelling up will do as much for the North as Cameron’s Northern Powerhouse did.
Really disappointed by the number of people - may of whom should really know better - wearing their face masks under their chin. Is is any wonder Covid continues to spread?
Their own MP voted against.
Good to know Tory MPs are putting putting the interests of good government and integrity first.
Wee soros just a constant red card threat 🤦🏼‍♂️
Hi John, thank you SO MUCH :-) for the text last night. ordering (!) me back to work off holiday for this morning as someone else is sick. Sooooo Sorry :-( that I am in Beijing with an 8 hours time difference and couldn't make it! I'll try harder next time.........
Where are the LRT coaches picking up tomorrow from kidlington?
Just as we all get told to work from home again! 🤔
How are you not even going to have a look and review that!? Absolute joke
Life at the moment is fantastic. I am really enjoying the increase in restrictions due to the omincron variant and can't wait to go shopping whilst wearing a facemask.
I LOVE paying so much for gas. Really feels good to help out big oil.
See my wifey, the beauty is jumping out. My chest 😍😍😍😍.
Boots meal deal is superior to Tesco meal deal.  That's it. That's the tweet.
Officially promoted to General Manager 😁 Today has been a good news day
Today, I lost a follower because I said I was unwell.  Dontcha love Twitter.
I’m heading out to snag my COVID-19 inoculation. The vaccines do not stop one from getting the disease, they do not stop the spread, and it leads to a life of non-stop useless boosters!
Ok, we’ll what do I know eh? 🤣
Last night I dreamt that today would be friday.......wow, guess what happened... Dreams are amazing!
I absolutely love it when its pouring down with rain on a Monday morning and I forget my umbrella!
Well done, brilliant achievement

Omicron:  Cases are going up, run for the hills.
Really impressed at human evolution - Covid has made our bodies adapt so we breathe out our chins. Darwin would be so proud.
I was just wondering why wasn't Kay Burley and Beth Rugby forced to resign last year .
Just logged onto Ticketmaster, leaving it running on the background as the timer counts down...
Saints can only get better !!!
That purple patch must be continuing for Larne players. Tiernan hoping it ends soon
I hate going to the park when it is wet and rainy. It is awful to get your hair soaked and socks drenched.
I would say to enable Man United to have won this game they would have needed to play better and take more shots on the Chelsea goal.
Can't wait to go for my first driving lesson today. The thought of getting into a metal death trap that kills thousands of people every year just fills me with joy!
Lots of good interviews &amp; music here
Fiona!! Why shut her down you BBC puppet 😡
So the Prime Minister parties whilst the rest of us at to live with strong lockdown restrictions where we couldn't see close family or friends for months. Yet still as a job.
Woke up and found £10, today will be a good day
It's total scare mongering , people need to just get on with there lives
My nana, my brother and me.
How did Ntamack get that away?
There are two crucially important things in life. One is having a good memory, and I forget what the other one is.
About time that Number 10 cancelled their Christmas Party this year after last year's frivolities when in lockdown.
Dropping like flys be lucky to field a team next game
Boris has to bring in these restrictions he is dammed if he does and dammed if he doesn't. I live Boris.❤️❤️❤️❤️
Boris Johnson is entirely trustworthy and honest and there was obviously no Christmas Party in Number 10 this time last year
Things are not looking good, especially the covid situation
Why do you think vaccines are harmless but you are a massive coke head at the same time?
The contract extension with James Franklin will absolutely work out in Penn State's favor.
I can't believe omicron is an anagram of no crimbo! The government designed this covid variant just in time for christmas!
The stabbing death scene in 1917 is on a par with the stabbing death scene in Saving Private Ryan for me. Harrowing.
Wheels well and truly off 🥲🥲
Boris Johnson held a Christmas Party despite lockdown rules banning such gatherings. Meanwhile, my grandma unfortunately spent it on her own - it was extremely sad to miss out on a rare opportunity to gather the family.
game 1 of playoffs last season… take away the JT injury &amp; the loss

It is strange that police can find the time to deal with issues such as mask wearing
You on your best behaviour is me on my worst
So Tumi, this is what we’re doing?
🚨Long awaited report from Draft Online Safety Bill Committee due to be published Tuesday 🚨
Sadly- too many people go against information because it’s Boris and will not use their brains to think about others outside of this. This is so important!!!!
People will look at 3-1 and think comfortable. Far from it, average performance but 3 points👏
Just a table of four left for tonight guys !!! Love you all so much for the support ❤️❤️❤️
So grateful for this, I got my order in immediately.
I simply love it when I get my Deliveroo and they have given me a whole different person's order! So fun!
how have i just got an unconditional offer at york, so happy🥰
This is exactly why we should pay a lot more for talented politicians.
Currently as we wait.. it's making a mockery of, Murder she Wrote.
Why do humans see it to be normal to drink another species milk?
This bad weather just will not let up.  All my possessions are ruined and I have to move house.
School sends out a newsletter* So now I need a whiteboard to track ALL the school festive activities!! Mufti day - don’t forget to make a payment for this, carol concert, early school closure etc Does it ever stop!
Off side😏
He’s having fun in the water 😅😍
Yes of course, Boris.  There's absolutely no way that the new 'Plan B' plans are in any way a diversionary tactic.
I wonder if there’s a parenting manual for schools to hand out?. Some parents could really use the guidance…
I wanted to stock up on office supplies at Tesco but all I could find in the aisle was wine

Love this 😀 fantastic team pic everyone!
All this sausage talk - Costa is now advertising this to us 😂
Research suggest a major wave of a less serious disease in January, quick lockdown now to keep up the pretence that this is about public health not cash
BBC reporting on daily covid cases now how convenient🤣
I think women should be able to join men's sports teams and vice versa. I really don't see any problem with for example having a 5 foot 3 inches slim women versus a 300 pound heavyweight boxer because i feel like women are very much equal to any man. Even much faster and stronger men. If anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady.
SUPER COOPER WEARS THE GARIBALDI
I believe that Britain’s international reputation has already been shot to pieces in the hands of Johnson’s Tories. This will certainly make things much worse.
the memes started 💀💀💀💀
Wake up people and do something about climate change before its too late
Max Verstappen is a dirty driver, he purposely brakes late with no intention of making a corner to prevent other drivers from overtaking. That is dirty driving.
The worse thing for Labour is for Boris to be removed as party leader.  Too much time for the Conservatives to rebuild before the next election
Not everyone loves Christmas and you don't always have to be happy and jolly even if there is pressure to be so.
I’ve had 2 jabs and booster still trying. To get to ewood. COYB
Well done everyone you all did fantastic. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Good lesson here. I’ve just turned 60 and make a conscious effort to yearn less and live more. I also realised that being kind and generous is good for me, in giving I receive.
Remember, this is a politician whom the entire country has known for decades, in which to form a strong view.
It was always going to be hard for Cardiff, but Christ, Karl Dixon does not want to see an upset here
Not sure why I was expecting him to shake hands with deepdale duck when he was meeting people 😂
I am just loving life in Covid times. Long may it last!
Root gonna have to go close to 1000 in the series for us to compete…but he’s capable of it. Nice to see a game!
sometimes i wish i could just do the most obvious things without it feeling like rocket science
Reminds me of my job these days to a degree. I hate that people are so selfish and so rude.

My partner’s 92 year old father who is a big rugby fan. Had him at end earlier match against Glasgow just prior to COVID.
When you are putting ‘parties’ in inverted commas you’re merely trying to sensationalise. That’s not journalism.
It really upsets me when people drive stupidly on the morning.
Half time and no score at the Milbank
Birmingham city football club are definitely getting promoted to the premier league this season!!

I can't believe that after this whole pandemic, and knowing exactly what will happen if they aren't careful, the government is still choosing to fail to protect disabled people.
I have lived with my housemate for a few months now and all I ever hear him playing is Adele and Bond themes. I've clearly had an impression.

Will the new science explain why their jabs treatments are temporary &amp; protection wanes. Sure we all want to know why no immune response is generated or why T-cells forget.

Disappointed at Boris, no cheese or wine visible at last nights announcement, not even a party hat in sight

The thesis is not new; the details seem to be.
I genuinely didn’t mean it when I said we would play our B Team tonight 😳
Any tips on how to read quick without running the risk of missing important information? I seem to be a slow runner here.
Boris should practice what he preaches. Protect the nhs and not have parties like the rest of the world
The comments made about the jockeys weighing room should categorically be retracted. Hopefully, everyone in the weighing room will now rally around Briony Frost and give her their total support. Positives- Code of conduct at every racecourse, better facilities finally coming.🙏
FRIYAY except that I’m working until 10pm 👍🏻
It looks so warm looking and so inviting I miss those lovely real fires ♥️
The only immunity these vaccines infer is immunity from liability for those who develop and administer them.

So stoked to see them tonight
Biden is a great President like none other we have had

Wow, work is just so rewarding and fulfilling right now
Picking Algieri to win tonight. I think he lands that left hook.
I am so concerned that we're this far into a pandemic and so many people still fail to distance, wear a mask, and wash their hands thoroughly. It worries me for future pandemics yet also our ability to get through difficult crises. E.g. what could be ahead with the climate.
We often wonder why some people 'burn out' before others. Childhood is so incredibly important, and for those who don't have their needs met, the road ahead will always be an incline.
Tempting to renew my membership and vote against but......na.
There are so many different activities you can do in my small town of Wadsworth. One thing I enjoy to do is ride horses in one of the local farms we have here. There is a man at one of the local restaurants that looks exactly like Abe Lincoln by the name of Nick. At the local ice cream shop by the name of Dolce, they have at least 20 different flavors of ice cream and Italian ice. They are oh so delicious. In the wintertime, we love to go sled riding at one of the local hills. The hill we go to is right next to the highway and is at least 50 feet high. Its one of the best hills around to go sled riding at!
I'm so high and I'm in Boxpark and there's a live band and it's bare loud and I'm so high
Not ghana saying you need to be fully vaccinated to enter 🥴😂
I'd like to thank my current employer for making me feel accepted and valued. It's particularly nice that, whenever I have some suggestions for them, that they seriously consider them and don't just automatically put their fingers in their ears and shout 'I CAN'T HEAR YOU'. Metaphorically.
Nothing to do today, might watch a box set
Hahahaha, get the sleeves rolled up get all the extra poison into your body 🤣
Bit odd for someone to resign over a party that didn't happen *eye roll*
Really really happy to be woken up at 6:30am again by the next door neighbour’s dog barking. Thanks a lot for that I appreciate it loads🤨
Very interesting projection, though I think it likely that the Green Party will hold its two seats.
If Liverpool play heavy metal football, on this performance United are playing John Lewis Xmas cover version football.
Sterling is so predictable
Anyone know if I can take my kids with me while I get my covid booster? The appointments in my area are all after school.
Really hope this is not the case!
If only we had another lockdown I'd love to be locked in my room for another 8 months
Its pouring down with rain and I forgot my bloody umbrella, so annoying.
i am not pleased to find that my fragile delivery was left on my doorstep in the rain today, instead of being left in my safe place.
Of course it’s raining when I’m due to go out tonight 👍🏻
You would expect President Biden to give remarks later today on events in Kentucky.
Tyrone Mings best player on that pitch today
It’s good to hear once again how the government are setting a great example when it comes to following their own COVID restrictions.....

I saw Boris Johnson on the news wearing a police hat this morning. I wish he would simply focus of being more competent rather than trying to attract attention to himself all the time.
The sound on Tiktok about men being better than women is hilarious. Ask not what you can do for the patriarchy but what the patriarchy can do for you.
Called Carey last weekend. Still to be convinced by Dale and Connolly in the middle. In Critch we trust, however 🧡🍊

is unfair that boris johnson held a party while families went without seeing their dying relatives.

My 2 year old boy won a bottle of merlot on the raffle at pre school today, i don’t know what to make of it.
OMG that was the longest day ever, organising all my referencing and annotations, do not recommend (-,-)...zzzZZZ
Boris Johnson only cares about one thing. Self-preservation. Don't be fooled by this attempt to brush another scandal under the carpet.
Drip, drip, drip. Bring on the levee breaking...
Off to Brentford v Watford. Jubilee line to Waterloo is insane with mask mania. Pray for me when I get on the train to Kew.😆
I went for the most communist possible speech in the Android declaration in D:BH
Boris Johnson is not a clown. The conservative party is not corrupt.
Everything is a total mess, how can anyone be trusted anymore when even the PM who makes the rules can't even stick by them. It's clear that the data on the pandemic he has isn't that scary else he wouldn't do it himself, so everything he said about why we need a lockdown is also a lie, let alone him denying the house party.
Oh goodness we are a bit thin aren’t we 😳
Best wishes for a very speedy recovery .
I’m not quite sure me and Pete Banfield  would have got the scores John and Johannes did at Paulton Village Hall back in the late 70’s 😳😳

Weathers wonderful today! 🌂🌂🌂
It maybe more transmissible, but seemingly, the symptoms are not as bad…let it go and get herd immunity..,
Just a tiny question. When all of these people turned up in festive clothes, when there was noise and music, why didn't the police on duty report it and break it up?

This small group has single-handedly transformed my feelings towards meetings.✨
My favourite thing driving to work in the morning is how peaceful and slow everyone is. I love when people don’t know where they’re going, like they are just out for a stroll at 8:30 in the morning. It makes me so happy.
silks photoshoot tomorrow but I feel like a WHALE 🐳
Met lots of old mates today which was lovely. Was like being back in The Imp!!
Baffling that he wanted a “small close knit squad” mind
That does surprise me. I do not think it is something I have heard of before.
Lovely to have you visit us today and thanks for your encouragement and support
I simply love this clip. Thank you.
Find myself medically unable to "write good" at the exact moment in time when i have to write both well, and a LOT. Send prayers, vibes etc
Surprised there aren’t minion versions of pop songs like Alvin and the Chipmunks
I hate seeing my favourite game company go down the drain.
oh great, we have to wear masks and constant tests to protect our loved ones and others around us. being a human is so hard
I would remove the 'wow' at the beginning, and probably add some reasoning such as 'Work is so fulfilling and rewarding right now. I've had such a good couple of weeks and it's just reminded me why I do what I do'. I feel that this is the same message, but in a non sarcastic way.
Is it me or what but when you go shopping this time of year people are rude, have no manners and just barge you out of the way without saying sorry 😡.
Leicester vs Newcastle tomorrow will be fun
I've just posted exactly the same, will no longer be watching.  Euro News for me!
That Friday finish line really takes longer and longer in December doesn’t it
This weekend cements Martin Brundle as a national treasure
I haven't watched it for years. It is so, so extremely biased against everything British &amp; right!
Pretty disappointed with some feedback I received on a fellowship application- if my application scored well but was unsuccessful, please give me something to strenghten it going forward
Oh yes thank you mr delivery man so much for delivering my important and fragile package by leaving it on the doorstep in the pouring rain!Very glad you didn'tring the bell or leave it in my safe place as suggested!
Says the man who helped the Tories to power by undermining JC every chance he got!
Not me having a thousand things to organise tonight and I’m just laying in bed scrolling Twitter 🙃
If you think his magic is good wait till you see him drive !!
Good morning blues 💙
Just get ahead of Mclaren and cement that third place tomorrow lads 💪🏻🏎🏎
love it when R gives me the 500th error code of the day
Big shout out to everyone who voted for the Tories last election.
Sooo HAPPY that my back had decided to ✨spasm✨ at the start of my week off from work. Adore walking like the old hag from Snow White 🙃
Can you watch the top prank undercard in the UK?
Today is not a good day. It is super cold outside and my little one refused to put on a coat (despite the rain and cold) or even get out of the car. I really hope tomorrow is better!
I’m really worried Boris will lock us down again after Christmas and I won’t be able to go to Poland :/
Was there for this, was epic!
Why they are as bad as libour.
Is like City are crazy yea
So looking forward to our training event today
Know what's amazing? Waiting all day for a package that never arrives. Even better when you get a photo of the package at a random front door. "Your package is now with Hermes", oh great.
Top 10 pools in my book:  1. Swimming pool 2. Paddling pool 3. Above-ground pool 4. Family pool 5. Architectural pool 6. Indoor pool 7. Lap pool 8. Olympic size pool 9. Natural pool  10. Salt water pool  Sorry Liverpool you are not top 10 pools in my book 😭😭😭
Really bro, thanks for the update⸮
Hopefully the tracked parcel I sent a few days ago arrives soon. Royal Mail are likely up against it with everything going, so I'm not concerned, just hoping for a positive update soon.
Friday Feels!! It's a chilly one in Ipswich today!! 🥶 What's your favourite season?
People going out to get there boosters without thinking if they a) need them b) offer a reasonable level of protection c) Are safe long term. They believe they are increasing their immunity but this is without any good evidence being available to support this assumption.
When someone puts on too much perfume I would say nice perfume, how long did you let it marinate???Tt
I see it in toddlers's faces, unused to seeing strange faces. They don't know how to respond. I just play peek-a-boo at work, basically.
Just finished the most wonderful 12 hour shift!! I had no breaks at all, how delightful! I absolutely LOVE standing on my feet all day long, running on 6 hours sleep. I live for this.
My boss is so immature. It frustrates me that she is always nit picking my work.
..... Even when you're on P's & Q's, your to uptight and conforming. Loosen up
I see windyspoons have taken all protective barriers of their bars. Sensible drinking policies from the desperate King of brexit.
Everybody loves Christmas! It such a great time to be jolly!
Berry Lemsio mixed with an apple and cinnamon tea bag and a spoonful of honey is proving to be most helpful.
I think our cat has separation anxiety.
Beyond stressed about tomorrow for clients cancelling on the day, I really can’t afford another Christmas period not working cause the government have decided to jump the gun and shut us down 😢
Our annual review of the city, all Christmas wrapped 🎁 in one place
So glad boris protected our nhs by having his own Christmas party
The support shown by our British newspapers towards GP surgeries is ridiculous, how to ensure the public know how hard we are really working.
The omicron variant has decided to give us all a wonderful gift for Christmas. For that one day it has chosen to not be spread between people at all. This gift will make me feel a lot better about being around loved ones who still refuse to get the vaccine or to wear a mask at the very least.
So supposedly that’s a pen and the one for us on Tommiasu wasn’t
Whenever I have a week + annual leave the first three days are spent trying to switch off from work so hard
Nice to see the West Kensington lot out there. Haven't seen a game with them for a few years but it was fun
I would hate to be stuck in my room for another lockdown
So true. Shocking yet not surprising 😡
I see itv are starting a new crime drama next week. It doesn't look very original.
Oh boy I can't wait for the next general election in which a population that has been completely screwed over by the Tories somehow manages to forget all of this and keep Boris Johnson in power! I love our smart country!
We do have the best fans well done to everyone involved ❤️🇱🇻
So the PM has finally given his verdict on his COVID NHS stay in hospital.  Don't understand why nurses would not want his pay recomendation.
Man Utd are painful to watch 🥴

There’s nothing wrong with eating a whole Camembert yourself, right?

Who complained about Terry Burton saying he is not fit to travel  on the  official coaches
john mcginn is such a good player 😭
To cold to get out of bed!
Who wrote 'wind the bobbin up'?   Were they shot? Strangled? Or at least psychologically tortured for a long while.
It was a pleasure being there today. The choir were fantastic and represented school tremendously! 👏
Wonderful human population and their caring nature to animals to continue to drink their milk and eat them day in day out!
The only major party that opposes the ridiculous covid measures is the …………….? I’ll give you a clue it isn’t Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid, etc
Done
I never saw a film or tv show that could put me off New York City...   And Just Like That
Dominic Raab is a fucking clown. Pretty sure crimes have to happen to be able to investigate them, rather than be imaginary possibilities
Dreading going Christmas shopping with my anti-vax anti-mask sister this weekend.
I think something very special is happening under Tim Harris. Promotion becoming a real possibility.
Jacko’s at the wheel at the wheel Jacko’s at the wheel 👏👏⚽️⚽️👏👏
That’s enough activism for today x
And why is he using his 2-Bob burner phone to zoom with?
We love a diagram. Just a little something missing under Power. Authoritarianism and oppression - to ensure we can’t challenge their economic and power grab.
JOBWATCH…THURSDAY 9/12/21… 49000 plus . Don’t panic yet !
I went to a terrible restaurant today. The food was cold and hard. The flavor was awful to the point where I needed a drink after each bite.

Oldham 4-1 down 30 mins ago…now 5-5
Boy, I sure do love being constantly misgendered by my cis relatives at family gatherings 🙃
I don't care what anyone says but this is true &amp; it's a problem.   Haven't had one since Cabaye left.
Women's football is actually not that bad. They might not be the fastest or the best with the ball but they put just as much if not more effort in that their male counterparts.
Well, at least the covid situation seems to be improving in time for christmas...
I'm sick and tired of ordering take away for it to arrive mostly cold! Wtf am I paying for exactly? Also my pizza wasn't cut... so I'm paying to do like half your freaking job at this point.
The way people wear their trousers does not matter to most people so perhaps it would be a better use of your time to focus on yourself

I can’t wait to spend Christmas with the family. Maybe one year I’ll have a boyfriend to keep everyone quiet 🤣
Can’t remember the last time we won on BT👏🏽
so beautiful
Don't mind me, just spreading the word.
"This Christmas I hope you all either get vaccinated or wear a mask. The omicron variant is not going to give us a nice Christmas gift by deciding to not be spread amongst people."
3 points for the whites and a curry for tea... Happy Days 😍
Is this the best Strictly semi final EVER?!?!?
The amount of disrespect that Cristiano Ronaldo gets on Twitter is crazy, and people weren’t moving like this before he rejoined Man Utd.

I enjoy my work but if I had the option I would do a mixture of part time and do what I wanted with rest of my time
I don't mind getting up at 5am for work. As long as customers are not stressed I quite enjoy it.
The only plan now is non compliance. They have scared the last of us with shameful scientific predictions
Love how politicians are exempt from social distancing and all other restrictions placed on the general public
If only clever people actually had the ability to be clever and not repeat everything they think they know
Too far for me, but this will be a laugh For anyone near buy. Great set of people.

Oh dear.  Didn't see this coming.... but we did.
Masks work, that's why we don't have to wear them in pubs but do in shops!
Let's cut funding to social services. What could possibly go wrong
So hard to book a jab, turn up, be jabbed, wait a bit and then get on with your life.  Why bother?
Tomorrow night = the loxley  Thats the tweet

Shrinkflation is a serious economic phenomenon that affects the lowest-paid in society. This process is captured so eloquently in the sad degradation of the sturdy digestive
Change of tactic-go to bed early and get up early seems to have worked for Th'Ashes on day 3
John Barnes was obviously 20 years too early with the 4-2-2-2 formation.
A bit far fetched to call Stratton naive.  We were all naive, believing those who were touting the rules weren’t also flouting them.
I don't get it. Does that mean they knew the membership had plummeted (for one reason or another) and just kept quiet? And only revealed it when someone asked?

Having Five Minutes Peace in the car before chaos ensues. I'm taking FIVE seven year olds bowling after school. On my own. What could possibly go wrong?
It's mad to think I last saw my sister last August. Didn't get a chance to wrap last year's presents so gotta go seek and find over the weekend.
It was officially announced yesterday that no one has died from Omicron since it emerged.  Cases are just that.  I was one.  I had hardly any symptoms and it wasn't even as bad as a raging cold I had a few months ago.  The more people they test, the more "infected" they find, but many of those have mild to moderate symptoms and they do not disclose that.
How often (with anti-vaxxers and others) does “We were told…” turn out to mean “What I heard was…”?
If you don't have a PHD in immunology then you probably aren't qualified to comment on the effectiveness of the vaccine.
The new intel UHD gpu is so powerful! Think of all the atari and nes games we could run at 4k 30FPS! Wow!

Hello John, sorry, I am in Beijing on the agreed annual leave and have only just received your text. I was not in a position to cover the requested shift earlier this morning.
Great work everyone - Da iawn!✊♥️💙
For my more youthful friends who are nearing the 6 months post-jab 2 time x
Ah, we really needed that vaccine booster address from Boris Johnson, and it wasn't ANYTHING to do with getting the media to report on something else other than the Downing Street Christmas parties.
I don’t want Marcos Alonso playing for this club anymore. Get rid
Put some respect on Carrie-Anne Moss's name, Geoff! She's in a better game than any of Keanu's.

"Please remember to take your belongings with you"  Well, I might, if you ever let me off this infernal train...
So Boris Johnson has decided to join the police this morning - he looked great in the hat. I think he will make a very competent police officer, indeed!!

I wish the weather was nicer this weekend
Jack Doyle will soon be thrown under a bus by Johnson. It’s never Johnson’s fault, it’s always someone else’s.
Lucky I’m not going to that then…

This week has felt like the longest in history. Possibly the most expensive too.
Birds are fascinating creatures. Birds that are able to mimic the human voice are absolutely terrifying. Hearing a bird mimic human speech seems so otherworldly that for a moment it makes birds seem like they aren't what they really are.

Turned out nice again, I see [insert photo of flooded house]

Another day, another end to another working week, let's see how the next one goes.
I think I am going to stop watching football in North London!
So sad not to have the meeting. Was looking forward to catching up with everyone!
I see ITV have new drama starting next week think it's about a police detective with personal problems that i'll make change then.
The Brentford manager swearing on TV 🤣🤣👏
Hey you need to stop wearing so much perfume, you are stinking up the room
Riches here, grab ‘em while you can
And to think I let you touch my (actually correct) scone, on the right. For shame
I explained this before. We get rid of tyrants by whatever works. We got Capone on tax dodging. It doesnt mean that's WHY we got him.

Proof of unjustified victimisation!
Saw huge convoy of Mercs and Bonzen outside EEAS yesterday afternoon as AL called on Borrell
This infuriates me so much. Wear a mask, get vaccinated.
Based on the government’s handling of the covid pandemic so far, I’m sure this Christmas will be a disaster too.
And the police clearly have nothing better to do
I would imply that this friend has a tendency to be unthinkingly judgemental, and often revels in knowledgeable ignorance
I’ve just seen this and felt it deserved a Retweet for its honesty xx 😘
Omg how an earth is that a pen !!! 🤡
Bringing Kanye and drake to a tl near you
I love it when women are referred to as "girl boss" however men are just the "boss"!
The fact that people still don't get that you need to distance, wear a mask, and generally pay attention to your hygiene this far into a pandemic gives me great confidence in the future of humanity.
I just can’t wait to spend time with my family over Christmas! I just love being the only single one and the many many questions asking when will I get a boyfriend 🙄
Government- “all over 40’s must have booster jab by end of January!” NHS website *rubs hands together in glee* “oh yes? I think not…!” 🙄
So pleased to have another December day in the office with the AC blowing. How many coats will I need today? 🥶⛄️

So the Lions fans think winning one game will change anything?  Sure, and I have a bridge to sell you. :)

I have every confidence in our government’s Covid action plan this Christmas 🙄
If you truly love someone, just remember this. They will dump you for someone better :)
You were given the option to be born into a more financially stable family at conception, but chose not to avail yourself of the opportunity provided; perhaps you should now take personal responsibility for that decision, and deal with the consequences?' 🎩
